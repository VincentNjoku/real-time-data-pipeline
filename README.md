## Objective
This project demonstrates a serverless application to process and store IoT sensor data in real time using AWS services like Lambda, S3, and DynamoDB.

## Features
- Simulates IoT sensor data and uploads it to an S3 bucket.
- Processes data in real-time with AWS Lambda.
- Stores transformed data in DynamoDB for persistence.
- Monitors the pipeline through CloudWatch logs.

## Technologies
